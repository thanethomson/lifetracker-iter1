# LifeTracker (iteration 1)

## Overview
This is the first iteration of the LifeTracker application, used for
demonstration purposes for a talk on the virtues of virtualisation (like
containerisation).

This particular iteration comes without any way of automatically deploying the
application or its database. This is the most manual of the 3 iterations when it
comes to deploying this stack.
